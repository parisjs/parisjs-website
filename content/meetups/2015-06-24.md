  - title: CSS at scale
    extract: |
      A little reminder about how CSS let's you do shit and how you should
      embrace the BEM methodology to make your code easy to read and write.

  - title: ng-build
    extract: |
      ng-build est un build system prévu pour simplifier le développement
      d'applications AngularJS. Basé sur les noms de fichiers, il évite au
      programmeur d'avoir à taper du boilerplate pour déclarer ses modules,
      controllers, directives et autres. Le prototype actuel est prévu pour
      fonctionner main dans la main avec Gulp, mais la prochaine version sera
      pourvue d'une interface CLI et de transformations pour browserify.

  - title: Web Analytics Automation Testing – Data beats Opinions
    extract: |
      Web analytics implementation is much more complex than most people think.
      Testing Web Analytics remains a cumbersome and complex task. Basically we
      have 4 alternatives:


      1- Blind faith: Trust and wish everything is right… or check only the
      pages that are part of your KPIs and funnels and hope for the best.

      2- Debuggers & proxies: Visit all pages through a proxy to make sure the
      tags are working as expected. Then wait… and check in your web analytics
      tools of choice to see if it was recorded correctly.

      3- Crawlers: Use a high-end tool or something like Web Link Validator.

      4- WASP: The Web Analytics Solution Profiler is a sidebar that offers
      page-by-page view of the tags as you surf. The crawler allows you to check
      a full site or section of a site.


      These approaches may work if you have a few tags in your website but
      definitely not if there are more than 500 variables to record, such as
      events, properties, tags, and so on. In this case, the automation of data
      correctness tests becomes crucial.


      During this session we will use a one-year real project to show you how a
      cross-functional team worked together to build a test framework based on
      open source tools. The team of Web Analyst, Developer in Test and
      Programmer worked together to build an Web Analytics Testing Framework and
      validate the correct Tagging. Our lesson is: “never assume, always check
      as early and as often as possible.”

  - title: "Websocket vs SSE, j'ai choisi mon camp"
    extract: |
      La bataille fait rage entre SSE et Websocket. L'objectif est de détailler
      notre position sur le sujet, avec choix d’architectures etc.
