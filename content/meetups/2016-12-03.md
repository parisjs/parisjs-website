  - title: 'DocSearch: The easiest way to add search to your documentation'
    extract: |-
      Everytime you discover a new framework or library, you have to spend time
      in its documentation. If you've recently used React, React Native, Eslint
      or Yarn you might have noticed that they have an ultra fast and relevant
      searchbar to let you find your content easily.


      They are using DocSearch, a entirely free product, that automatically
      crawl a documentation website every 24h, coupled with a tiny JS library to
      display results in a dropdown menu.


      In this talk I will explain how DocSearch works internally, and how you
      can easily add it to your own documentation.

  - title: Five minutes before prod
    extract: |-
      This talk is about how we build & deploy a complex AngularJS/TypeScript
      app in production at Aircall.


      I will describe what happens between a git push production command and the
      release of it (Webpack build, tests & AWS CodeDeploy).


      I will release a new Aircall feature in live, during the talk.

      As we use a continuous integration and delivery platform, the talk will be
      animated with the life cycle of a build.

  - title: "Stop wasting your users' time, make them happy"
    extract: |-
      You're in the metro and want to load your favorite web app. After waiting
      10 seconds without any response from the app, you close your browser,
      angry. How can you avoid this classic user story?


      With this talk, learn how to take advantage of your web application
      loading time! On the menu: picture optimizing, uncommon loaders,
      preloading templates, requests orchestration...

      As APIs have become increasingly more important and popular in usage in
