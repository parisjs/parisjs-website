In this talk I&#x27;ll dive deep into the internals of the Glimmer VM, show how it&#x27;s powers can be leveraged via Glimmer.js and explain what benefits TypeScript that both are written in provides. I&#x27;ll end with a look into the future and explain how Glimmer.js and Ember.js will form an ecosystem that apps of all sizes can flourish in.

Looking at realistic examples, I explain these kinds of attacks, and outline the tools that modern browsers provide to combat them.

As a developer who turns caffeine into code, this is unacceptable. The only thing to do was use code to make coffee.

This is the story of how I hacked an API onto my coffee machine. We&#x27;ll look at why you would chose JavaScript to hack the machine, what you need to do to take control of a coffee machine (without too many shocks), and what other things we can do with JavaScript and hardware. As we wrap up with a look at what&#x27;s next for my project, you&#x27;ll be dreaming of the gadgets in your house that you can&#x27;t wait to rip open and give an API.
