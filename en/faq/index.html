<h3 id="what-is-parisjs"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-parisjs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What is Paris.js?</h3>
<p>Paris.js is a <strong>community</strong> of <strong>JavaScript developers</strong> - beginners or experts, professionals or hobbyists.
Paris.js organizes a meetup <strong>every last Wednesday of the month</strong> with speakers from the community. Each event ends with food, drinks and time for members to exchange ideas, chat, and network.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-parisjs"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#who-is-parisjs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Who is Paris.js?</h3>
<p><strong>You are!</strong> Paris.js is not affiliated with any company and doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúofficial‚Äù status. The community exists on its own and is managed by those who are interested in getting involved. As a community, it‚Äôs important for us to be <strong>free and independent</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="is-parisjs-brand-new"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#is-parisjs-brand-new"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Is Paris.js brand new?</h3>
<p>No, it is not. The first event was held way <strong>back in October 2010</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-contribute-to-the-community"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#how-can-i-contribute-to-the-community"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How can I contribute to the community?</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to get involved in the Paris.js organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#how-can-i-submit-a-talk">present a talk</a></li>
<li><a href="#i-want-to-host-a-meetup">have your company host a meetup</a></li>
<li><a href="#funding">Make a donation</a></li>
<li>join in on organizational discussions</li>
<li>help maintain and develop the website</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to get started is by sending a message to the mailing list, slack channel or meet volunteers at the next event.</p>

<p>While there are no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù ties between Paris.js and other Paris-based Javascript meetups, we‚Äôre all quite friendly and many contributors to Paris.js are also involved in other meetups. Paris.js happily promotes and spreads the word about other similar events.</p>

<p>You can find more on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-js/">Meetup.com</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/parisjs">Twitter</a>, and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/parisjs">mailing-list</a> or <a href="https://slack-francejs.now.sh/">slack channel</a> (via France.js).</p>
<h2 id="the-meetups"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#the-meetups"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The ‚ÄúMeetups‚Äù</h2>
<h3 id="what-do-meetups-talk-about"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#what-do-meetups-talk-about"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What do meetups talk about?</h3>
<p>We focus most heavily on <strong>Javascript-related</strong> topics, but we may also explore a wider array of <strong>front-end</strong> tech topics from time to time. Additionally, we have had speakers <strong>dive into their experience as entrepreneurs</strong>. Essentially, we consider anything that could pique the interest of modern developers under our potential umbrella.</p>
<h3 id="when-is-the-next-meetup"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#when-is-the-next-meetup"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>When is the next meetup?</h3>
<p>Meetups usually happen <strong>every last Wednesday of the month</strong>.<br/>
We usually don&#x27;t have meetups during the lowest month of summer and in December.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-attend-is-it-free"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#how-can-i-attend-is-it-free"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How can I attend? Is it free?</h3>
<p>All events are <strong>free</strong>! We open registration on meetup.com about a week before each event. To attend, you simply need to register - but be quick, tickets are generally gone within a day.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-submit-a-talk"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#how-can-i-submit-a-talk"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How can I submit a talk?</h3>
<p>First off, thanks a bunch - speakers are crucial to what we do! We generally propose two types of talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>lightning talks (5 minutes)</strong>: generate enthusiasm; demo something neat</li>
<li><strong>full length talks (20 minutes)</strong>: dig deeper in a topic; do a live-coding session</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to submit a talk is through <a href="/en/submission/talk">our dedicated form</a>.
Please do not submit any commercial talks.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-talks-chosen"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#how-are-talks-chosen"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How are talks chosen?</h3>
<p>Talks are selected 2 weeks before the event (second week of the month). Popular talks are chosen via a public Hangout which is announced on the mailing-list. Everyone can upvote the talks on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/parisjs/talks">Parisjs/talks</a>..</p>
<h3 id="i-want-to-host-a-meetup"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#i-want-to-host-a-meetup"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>I want to host a meetup!</h3>
<p>We are always looking for new companies to host our meetups. The only (small!) conditions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the venue should be large enough for 50+ attendees.</li>
<li>it should be located within the borders of Paris city.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the beginning of the event, you will get some time to introduce your company and recruitment opportunities. <a href="/en/sponsors">See sponsors page</a></p>
<h2 id="sponsoring-publicity"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#sponsoring-publicity"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Sponsoring, Publicity</h2>
<h3 id="i-want-to-sponsor-a-meetup"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#i-want-to-sponsor-a-meetup"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>I want to sponsor a meetup!</h3>
<p>The only way to ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù is by hosting a meetup. See ‚ÄúI want to host a meetup‚Äù.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-advertise-my-event-to-your-members"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#can-you-advertise-my-event-to-your-members"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Can you advertise my event to your members?</h3>
<p>The rule of thumb is that we do not do advertisements for paid events. If the event is free and is on a topic related to Paris.js, we‚Äôd be happy to talk about it. Just send a message through meetup.com or on our mailing list.</p>
<h3 id="funding"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#funding"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Funding</h3>
<p>In the same spirit of openness and sharing, we have opened a page on <a href="https://opencollective.com/parisjs">opencollective</a>.<br/>
You can contribute financially to Paris.js by making a donation. It offers no compensation.<br/>
Our annual budget is low, the extra money will be used to create goodies, gifts for speakers, pay a last minute buffet.<br/>
To avoid creating a structure, we rely on an external <a href="https://opencollective.com/faq/collectives#what-is-a-host-do-i-need-one-">host</a>, opencollective.fr (<a href="https://www.societe.com/societe/opencollective-paris-oc-842144263.html">https://www.societe.com/societe/opencollective-paris-oc-842144263.html</a>). It is this association that manages the money and makes the transfers to reimburse the expenses.</p>
